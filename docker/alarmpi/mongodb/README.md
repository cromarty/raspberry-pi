# Base Arch Linux Docker Containers for the Raspberry Pi

The Docker image:

	actuit/rpi-base-archlinux

Was generated with 
[mkimage-arch.sh][mkimage]

See the contents of this repo at:

	aaframework/tools/alarmpi/docker/base

For code which will generate a base Arch Linux ARM image to run on a Pi.

And other directories at the same level, for example:

	aaframework/tools/alarmpi/docker/mongodb

Which will contain other image generating code.
